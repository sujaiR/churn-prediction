# 📊 Churn Prediction Using TensorFlow

This project predicts **customer churn** using machine learning. It leverages **TensorFlow** to train a classification model that determines the likelihood of a customer leaving a service.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is when a customer stops using a service. Businesses use churn prediction models to **retain customers** by identifying who is likely to leave and taking proactive actions.

This project includes:
✅ Data preprocessing  
✅ Training a **TensorFlow neural network**  
✅ Making predictions on new data  
✅ Model evaluation with accuracy metrics

## 📂 Dataset Information

The dataset used is **`Churn.csv`**, which contains customer information such as:
- `CustomerID`: Unique customer identifier  
- `Tenure`: Number of months the customer has been with the company  
- `MonthlyCharges`: Amount billed per month  
- `TotalCharges`: Total amount billed  
- `Churn`: **Target variable (1 = Churn, 0 = Retained)**
